# House-price-prediction
OVERVIEW:
This project aims to predict house prices using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable system that can estimate house prices based on input parameters.

Features
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Model Training (Regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
Model Evaluation (R-squared, RMSE, MAE)
Deployment (Flask/Django for web-based prediction)

TECH  STACK:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
